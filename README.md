📌 Project Title

COVID-19 Data Analysis Dashboard

📖 Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 data using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
It visualizes key trends such as case growth, recovery rates, and death rates across time and countries.
The final output is an interactive dashboard built with Plotly to explore data insights easily.

🎯 Objective

To explore and clean a public COVID-19 dataset.

To perform data analysis and find meaningful patterns.

To create visualizations (static & interactive) to understand COVID-19 trends.
